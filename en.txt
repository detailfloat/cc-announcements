Happy 2026! Glad to announce Endless mode has been added to the 'Language-beta' track on Steam. Try it out and let us know your feedback.

We added more Achievements too. More details on Discord and on Steam Community posts.

<u>Dev Notes:</u>
- If you find your voice not triggering spells, go to the Game Settings and Reset Voice
- Voice recognition might miss some accents. We’re improving it, and feedback from a broader range of players will help us tune it further.
- There may be some desyncing issues with players who drop-in/out of active game sessions
- Bugs: In rare cases, Dungeons are not generated properly. We are working on it. 
- Help us improve by sending error logs to the devs via Discord

If you're enjoying the game, <u>please leave us a Steam review</u> - it really helps.
We're a tiny indie team & we read as much feedback as we can. 
Thanks for playing the Early Access! :)
