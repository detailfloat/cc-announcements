Announcing Endless Mode! See how far your team can progress and get those Achievements! 

More details on Discord and Steam Community on how Endless Mode works. 

<u>Dev Notes:</u>
- Latest version 0.9.18 contains mostly bug fixes.
- We are fixing desyncing issues with players who drop-in/out of active game sessions
- If you find your voice not triggering spells, go to the Game Settings and Reset Voice
- Voice recognition might miss some accents. We’re improving it.

If you're enjoying the game, <u>please leave us a Steam review</u> - it really helps.
We're a tiny indie team & we read as much feedback as we can. 
Thanks for playing the Early Access! :)
