Thanks for playing the Early Access!

<u>Dev Notes:</u>
- If you find your voice not triggering spells, go to the Game Settings and Reset Voice
- Voice recognition might miss some accents. We’re improving it, and feedback from a broader range of players will help us tune it further.
- There may be some desyncing issues with players who drop-in/out of active game sessions
- If you are looking to play in another language, please to go Steam > Cursed Companions > Settings > Betas > Select 'language-beta'

If you're enjoying the game, <b>please leave us a Steam review</b> - it really helps.
We're a tiny indie team & we read as much feedback as we can. Join our Discord to share bugs, feedback or clips with our community. 
Have fun & thank you for the support!
